   Abstraction : hiding implementation details and showing any functionalty to user
   
   
   Two types of Abstraction :
   
   1> Abstract class (0 to 100 %)
   2> Interface (100%)
   
   
   
   1> Abstract class
   -> will use abstract keyword
   -> abstract as well as non abstract methods
   -> final methods
   -> constructors and static methods also
   -> cannot be instantiated
   
   
   abstract A
   {
   }
   
   
   class B extends A
   {
   		abstract method a()
   }
   
   class C  EXTENDS B
   {
   		void a()
   		{};
   		
   }
